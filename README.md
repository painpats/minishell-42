# minishell-42

`minishell` is the first **group project** of the common core at 42's school. This project is about creating a simplified version of the Unix shell. Here we learned a lot about processes and file descriptors.

We discovered how shell environments work, including command parsing, execution, and built-in commands. This project focuses on mastering process management and inter-process communication.

## Objectives

- Implement a basic shell with essential features.
- Understand command execution, environment variables, and process management.
- Handle signals and process termination gracefully.

## Features

- Command parsing and execution.
- Built-in commands (`cd`, `echo`, `env`, `exit`, `pwd`, `unset`, `export`).
- Environment variable management.
- Support for pipes and redirection.
- Handling of background processes.

## Installation

To use `minishell`, simply clone the repository and compile it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minishell-42.git
   cd minishell-42
   ```

## Usage

Compile and run the shell:
  ```bash
  make
  ./minishell
  ```

Then enter commands as you would in a regular terminal, use built-in commands for navigation and file manipulation.
